Best practice for choosing an array method would depend on the specific use case and requirements of the application. However, some general best practices include:

Use array methods to avoid mutation: Many array methods return a new array instead of modifying the original array, which can help prevent unintended side effects and make code easier to reason about.

Use arrow functions for callback functions: Arrow functions are a concise and readable way to write callback functions for array methods.

Use method chaining: Method chaining allows you to perform multiple operations on an array in a single statement, which can make code more readable and efficient.

Use descriptive variable names: Use descriptive variable names to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
